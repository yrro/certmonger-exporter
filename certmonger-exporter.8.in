.UR https://\:pagure\:.io/\:certmonger/\:blob/\:master/\:f\:/src/\:tdbus\:.h
D-Bus API
.UE .
Normally, only the
.I root
user is allowed to access this API,
so we ship a D-Bus policy which grants the
.I nobody
user read-only access to the API.
The user is not able to make any changes to,
or read the private keys of any tracking requests.
